## Reflection

A very awkward exam period, where every 2 weeks there was a different 
assignment, which due to the time limit, was prioritized, which 
left little time for this exam. Especially annoying is that this 
exam which has by far the longest project time given of all the exams, 
was pushed down on the list until the last few weeks. Then the internet 
was cut by some roadwork and was down for a few days, which made development 
harder.
