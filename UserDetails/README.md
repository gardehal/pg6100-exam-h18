# Documentation for pg6100-exam

This exam has probably been the most chaotic one ive had this semester. I started working ever so slightly when we first 
got the exam, but then we began having an exam every other week, and sadly, i prioritized them. Fast forwards to when this
exam was the only one left, i went back to the project i'd started on, and started getting a lot of problems. That is what
i used the majority of the time on, going back and forth trying to get the project to run.

As a starting point I used code from the repository we used in class (https://github.com/arcuri82/testing_security_development_enterprise_systems/tree/master/advanced).

I used the frontend repository (SPA-rest) as a starting point first, but then later found another repository that was simpler, and which i thought would be easier to work with, when thinking of that we had to in the end implement all these APIs together.

I saved some of the code i already had, but changed my attention over to the rest repository (news-rest-v2), and wrote the
base project out of this.

Some problems was easy to fix, but the main problem was that I kept getting the error "error creating bean", which i did not find a
solution to. My main goal throughout the exam has been to mainly solve this problem, so that i could progress, which meant that
i continually changed my code, and ended up with the project still not working. I could see what was the problem, and where the problem
where, but not how to fix it.

### Problems and errors
The main problem with this project was that I knew that there might not necessarily be any error with the code, but rather with
some of the projects configurations or how i set up the project to run, this is because of the class project pg6100, worked as it should.

### Where to go from here
I think that from here, if i would continue, I would focus on the basics, to fully get an overview, so that I could get the project
to build. I would maybe have cooperated more with my group members and wrote the project from start again. Regardless, i think that
without the errors that occurred, and with the right configurations, that the project would have run. And had we gotten there,
we could have started working on the common task in the exam.

### Code from pg6100 repository
As i mentioned, i used code from the pg6100 repository from class, this includes;

* **advanced/frontend/sparest/spa-rest-backend**
* **advanced/rest/news-rest-v2**
