## Common Documentation

Since no members finished their API, we did not progress to make a common/shared API. Therefore there is no documentation 
concerning this. The detail of each members API should be in their respective module.

Due to other exams and individual problems we did not meet much other than in and after class. Once the assignment was given, 
we met to delegate API and discuss high level view strategy and use of Git. We also chose to merge our branches into the master
branch, even though we did not finish the task which was the reason to create a branch. We did this because it would be easier for 
the examinators to review the project without jumping to each branch.
